# CG4002_external_comm
This is the external communication part for CG4002 in NUS AY21/22 sem 2  

The details of implementation are in the report. This repo serves as a guide for CEG students to do CG4002 external communication part, while having no prior knowledge and the professor/lecturer refrain from helping.

You may wonder why I complete the full external communication part but still got D. The lecturer said he needs a fully functional project while I'm doing the project on my own, which he promised that I can do my part only.

So, good job, Jithin. You don't want to teach, I teach for you.

In case of any doubts on the code/report, you are more than welcome to ask me via telegram @itachi12138.
